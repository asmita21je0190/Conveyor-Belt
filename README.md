A belt conveyor system with product counter and weight measurement unit.

This system can be used individually as an intermediate secondary system to convey a product (eg: packed cement bags) from one system to another.

Counter(+) & counter(-) buttons are used to adjust the number of products required.

Enter button is used to set the adjusted product count and turn on the system.

Here, load cell is used as the weight measuring sensor to detect whether the product is in 800g-1200g range.

If the Product is not within the range, the fourth motor(04) will act as a reject arm(screw linear motion) and push the rejected product from the weight measuring plate to a side.(to an another system or waste bin)

If the product is in the 800g-1200g range, then the product is conveyed to the second belt area using third motor(03), which starts the first belt conveyor.

The product will continue along the second belt area until it gets detected by the IR sensor, which will count the product passing through.

If the set product count and number of products detected by IR sensor is equal; the system will stop after a time delay. (Time delay is used to convey the last counted product to be moved to the next belt area)

Then the third belt will convey the product to the next system.
